## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Modern & Immersive UI**: A visually appealing interface with gradient backgrounds, animated elements, and a clean, tab-based layout.
*   **Flexible File Support**: Upload and analyze a wide variety of code files, including `.c`, `.py`, `.java`, and more. The system smartly validates that all files in a batch are of the same type.
*   **Interactive Analytics Dashboard**:
    *   **Highest Similarity Metric**: Instantly see the most critical plagiarism score.
    *   **Risk Level Assessment**: Automatically categorizes the highest similarity into "Low," "Medium," or "High" risk.
    *   **Similarity Distribution Histogram**: Get a high-level overview of the plagiarism landscape across all comparisons.
    *   **Similarity Matrix Heatmap**: A powerful grid that visualizes the similarity score for every file-to-file comparison, making it easy to spot clusters of cheating.
*   **Detailed HTML Reports**: Generate and download a comprehensive report with side-by-side code comparisons and highlighted plagiarism areas.
*   **Analysis History**: Track your detection jobs over time with a historical log and a trend chart showing the maximum similarity found in each batch.
*   **Built for Simplicity**: A clear, three-step process makes it incredibly easy to use: Upload -> Detect -> Analyze.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

CADS doesn't just look for copied lines; it analyzes the underlying structure of the code using a proven technique called **fingerprinting**.

1.  **Tokenization**: The source code is broken down into a sequence of fundamental units, or "tokens."
2.  **K-gram Analysis**: The system creates overlapping sequences of these tokens (called k-grams).
3.  **Winnowing Algorithm**: To improve efficiency without sacrificing accuracy, a winnowing algorithm is used to select a smaller, representative set of fingerprints from the k-grams.
4.  **Comparison**: Finally, the system compares the fingerprint sets from all files to calculate a similarity score for each pair.
